# Project Title
Hire-A-Dog-Walker Website 

# Tools Used
HTML, CSS, Notepad++ and Opera web-browser including its ‘Developer Tools’

# Description
A website which users would use to hire a dog walker from a dog-walking company / service. I designed the page myself as well as implemented a navigation bar including multiple drop-down menus, the ‘Contact-Us Form’ and a search bar intended to be powered by Google though was not yet functional. I also planned on adding in a ‘Google Map’ of where the company operated but instead (due to knowledge constraints) simply used an image which acted as a link which directed the user to the company’s address shown in Google Maps.
